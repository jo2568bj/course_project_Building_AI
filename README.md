# Course Project: Building AI
Building AI course project

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Not a finished idea, but the idea of being able to collect open data from the internet based on input data about geographical location, carry out calculations, and based on the output (in the form of diagrams) be able to generate risk reports to streamline report writing.

Building AI course project


## Background

Streamlining work and saving time and financial resources. Can streamline the exercise of public authority. These reports do not unusually need to be carried out in the case of new construction, for example.


## How is it used?

For example, they can be consultants who, on behalf of the client, need to assess the level of risk to ensure safe urban development.


## Data sources and AI methods

Much of the input data is openly available on the internet. Methods are usually described in government reports.

## Challenges

I think that the most important thing is to include an engineering assessment and review to ensure the conclusions and that the right level of any recommended risk mitigation measures is correct. But that much of the work before that is automated.

## What next?

Mainly more knowledge in programming would be needed to realize this project.
